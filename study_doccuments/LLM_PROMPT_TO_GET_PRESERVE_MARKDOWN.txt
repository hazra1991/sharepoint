You must output RAW Markdown only.

Requirements:
- Do NOT render, interpret, or format the content.
- Preserve all Markdown syntax literally, including inner ``` code fences.
- Wrap the entire output in an OUTER fenced block using four backticks (````).
- Inner Markdown code blocks MUST remain as literal ``` blocks.
- No explanations, no commentary, no extra text outside the outer fence.
- The result must be copyable in one click and pasteable as a valid .md file.

Task:
Convert the provided text into Markdown while preserving all examples, code blocks, and semantics exactly.
